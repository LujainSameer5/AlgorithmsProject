Project's Idea
* Our idea based on matching string , specifically  kunth-Morris-Pratt .

When you run the code a menu with 3 choices will appear :
1- Exit the game 2-File matching 3-Enter  the game.

If you chose file matching your answer will be corrected only if it matches the info on the file.

You will have 5 questions with 3 multiple choices.

There are 3 deferent levels on the game.

Only correct answers will be counted.
